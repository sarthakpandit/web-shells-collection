I find a LOT of variants of web application backdoors. So I like to analyse em. So, I figured, lets start a project where people can send me the ones they find and I can upload, categorize, etc.

This way we can kinda crowdsource the "finding out what ones are backdoored", etc.

// Feck, I broke SVN. Again. //

// Resetting Repos did not fix it...

// I will be remaking this project later to "fix" the issue
